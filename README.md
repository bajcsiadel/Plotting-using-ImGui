# Plotting-using-ImGui
This is a project to plot data from binary file realised in c++ using ImGui as UI.

Install OpenCV by following the (link)[https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-4-4-on-ubuntu-18-04/?fbclid=IwAR2fN4nVyeWYnkW8Zb2wvBsFMsCTURHzm3kfQFGI8OxrO7u0NF_CQO8rGzA]. You can skip step 3, because in this project we do not need the python extensio of the openCV. After that execute the following commands:

1. sudo cp $(cwd)/installation/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/opencv.pc
2. cd $(cwd)/installation/lib
sudo pwd > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf
